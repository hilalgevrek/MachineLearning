# MachineLearning

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves developing algorithms and models that can 
learn patterns and make predictions or decisions based on data without being explicitly programmed. In other words, it is 
the ability of computers to learn from data and improve their performance in a task as they gain more experience.

The goal of machine learning is to develop algorithms that can automatically learn from data and make accurate predictions 
or decisions. Machine learning algorithms are trained on large datasets, and they use statistical techniques to identify 
patterns and relationships within the data. Once the model has been trained, it can be used to make predictions or decisions 
on new data.

Machine learning is used in a wide range of applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech 
recognition, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and many others. It is a rapidly growing field that is transforming 
the way we interact with technology, and it has the potential to revolutionize many industries in the years to come.
