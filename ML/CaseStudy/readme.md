# Regression #

Regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (also known as the response 
or outcome variable) and one or more independent variables (also known as predictors or explanatory variables). The goal of 
regression analysis is to find a mathematical function that can accurately predict the value of the dependent variable based on 
the values of the independent variables.

The most commonly used type of regression analysis is linear regression, which involves fitting a straight line to the data. 
However, there are many other types of regression analysis, including polynomial regression, logistic regression, and multiple 
regression.

Regression analysis is widely used in many fields, including economics, finance, psychology, social sciences, and engineering, 
among others. It can be used for predicting future values of the dependent variable, identifying the factors that contribute to 
its variation, and testing hypotheses about the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables.

# Classification #

Classification is a machine learning technique that involves assigning categorical labels to data points based on their features. 
The goal of classification is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict the class or category of new, unseen data 
points based on patterns learned from a training dataset.

In a classification problem, the input data is represented by a set of features or variables, and each data point is assigned a label 
or class. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and learns to associate certain features with certain classes. Once the model is 
trained, it can be used to predict the class of new, unseen data points.

Classification is widely used in many applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, fraud detection, spam 
filtering, and many others. There are many types of classification algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, logistic 
regression, support vector machines (SVMs), and neural networks, among others. The choice of algorithm depends on the nature of the 
data, the size of the dataset, and the desired level of accuracy.
