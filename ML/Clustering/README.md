# MachineLearning-Clustering

# Clustering #

Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together into clusters. The goal of 
clustering is to identify natural groupings in the data, where the objects within each group are more similar to each other 
than they are to objects in other groups.

Clustering algorithms work by first defining a measure of similarity between data points, such as Euclidean distance 
or cosine similarity. The algorithm then groups the data points together based on their similarity, with the goal of maximizing 
the similarity within each group and minimizing the similarity between groups.

Clustering is commonly used in a variety of applications, such as customer segmentation, image segmentation, document clustering, 
and anomaly detection. Some of the popular clustering algorithms include k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and 
density-based clustering such as DBSCAN.
