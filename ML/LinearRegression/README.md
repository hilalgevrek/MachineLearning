# Linear Regression #

Linear regression is a type of supervised learning algorithm used in machine learning to model 
the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal of 
linear regression is to find the line of best fit that describes the relationship between the variables.

In simple linear regression, there is only one independent variable, while in multiple linear regression, 
there are multiple independent variables. The equation for simple linear regression can be represented as:

Y = a + bX + e

Where Y is the dependent variable, X is the independent variable, a is the intercept, b is the slope, 
and e is the error term. The goal of linear regression is to estimate the values of a and b that minimize 
the sum of the squared error between the predicted values and the actual values.

Linear regression is commonly used for tasks such as prediction, forecasting, and trend analysis. It is a widely 
used and relatively simple method that can provide useful insights into relationships between variables.
