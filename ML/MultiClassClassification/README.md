# Multi-Class Classification #

Multi-class classification is a type of classification problem in machine learning where the goal is to assign 
an input data point to one of several possible output classes. In other words, the task is to predict the correct 
class label among a set of predefined classes for a given input sample.

For example, in an image classification task, the goal is to classify an image into one of several predefined categories, 
such as "dog", "cat", "bird", "car", etc. Similarly, in a sentiment analysis task, the goal is to classify a piece of 
text as positive, negative, or neutral.

Multi-class classification is often performed using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, 
random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. The choice of algorithm depends on the complexity of the problem, 
size of the dataset, and performance requirements.
