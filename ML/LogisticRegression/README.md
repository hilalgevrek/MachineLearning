# Logistic Regression #

Logistic regression is a statistical machine learning algorithm that is used for binary classification problems. 
In binary classification, the goal is to predict whether a given input belongs to one of two possible categories, 
often represented as 0 or 1.

The logistic regression algorithm models the probability of an input belonging to the positive class (represented as 1) 
as a function of the input features. The output of the logistic regression algorithm is a value between 0 and 1, 
which represents the predicted probability of the input belonging to the positive class.

Logistic regression works by fitting a logistic function to the data, which maps the input features to the predicted 
probability of the positive class. The logistic function is a sigmoid function that has an S-shaped curve, which allows 
it to smoothly transition from 0 to 1 as the input features change.

Logistic regression can be trained using a variety of optimization techniques, such as gradient descent or Newton's method, 
to minimize the error between the predicted probabilities and the true labels in the training data. Logistic regression can 
also be extended to handle multiclass classification problems using techniques such as one-vs-rest or softmax regression.
