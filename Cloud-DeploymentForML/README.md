# Streamlit #

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that is used to create interactive web applications for data science 
and machine learning projects. It enables developers to quickly create and share interactive dashboards, data visualizations, 
and machine learning models without having to write extensive HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code.

With Streamlit, developers can create web applications by writing Python scripts that are automatically turned into 
interactive web apps. It provides a simple API for developers to create and customize widgets, charts, and other interactive 
elements in their web applications. Additionally, Streamlit allows for easy integration with other popular Python libraries 
such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

Streamlit is becoming increasingly popular among data scientists, machine learning engineers, and software developers due to 
its ease of use, quick prototyping capabilities, and ability to streamline the development process for web applications.
